# SegmentSavvy-Dynamic-ETA-Route-Prediction-for-Koramangala-Bangalore
SegmentSavvy is a machine learning project that enhances ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) and route prediction in Bangalore. The project focuses on dividing the city’s core areas, such as Koramangala and Indira Nagar, into smaller road segments. This approach allows for precise, real-time predictions that adapt as users move through the city

Key Features:
Segment-Based Approach: The project divides Bangalore’s core areas, including Koramangala and Indira Nagar, into smaller road segments, enabling fine-tuned ETA and route predictions.

Real-Time Data Integration: Leveraging GPS data from millions of smartphones, SegmentSavvy continuously updates ETAs and route suggestions based on live traffic conditions.

Open Source Data Utilization: The project utilizes open-source data from platforms like OpenStreetMaps and explores the potential of Google Maps APIs to gather and simulate the necessary road segment data.

Dynamic and Adaptive Predictions: As users progress along their journey, the model dynamically recalculates both the ETA and the most efficient route, ensuring optimal travel times.

Bangalore-Centric: SegmentSavvy is specifically tailored for Bangalore’s traffic dynamics, focusing on the most congested and frequently traveled areas of the city.
